⛓️What is a liquidity mining pool? 🐝
A Liquidity Mining Pool shows that by locking their tokens into a smart contract, users can earn a portion of the fees that are generated from trading activity in the pool.

⛓️How Does Liquidity Mining Pool work?

In crypto liquidity mining, you earn rewards by letting a decentralized trading service work with some of your cryptocurrency tokens. These tokens will facilitate low-friction trades between anonymous crypto holders.


⛓️Challanges Encountered
Chidubem:
My laptop was slow and laggy, i have to uninstall and delete some apps. My laptop battery capacity is low and doesnt last up to 5 minutes and i have to move to a place with constant electricity everyday.
I initially have trouble finding some functions which will enable the users to stake at different times, but i later figured it out. I have difficulty deploying the smart contract at first but after going through the code i then saw the bug and fixed it.

Ekene:
Fell sick and recovered and have to try to contribute to the writing of the smart contract. Having hard time discoving some necessary functions to be passed.

⛓️Problems solved:
Chidubem:
I was able to debug and see where i was wrong in my config file. I have to find a region where there is constant power supply to enable me to complete the project.

Ekene:
Recovered from sickness and have to continue from where i stopped. Have to study to find the required necessary functions needed to write the smart contract.
